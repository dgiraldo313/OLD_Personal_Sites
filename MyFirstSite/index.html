            <h3><strong>Hello there...</strong> </h3>
            <p>My name is Daniel Giraldo and I’m a Junior at <a href="http://www.drew.edu" target="_blank">Drew University</a>. I'm currently pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science, and  minoring in Spanish Studies and Economics. My favorite class so far during my three years at Drew has definitely been the introduction to Computer Science. This class allowed me to find in me a passion for programming and learn more about my problem solving abilities.</p>

            <p>When I’m not hitting the books you will most likely find me out on the Drew Ranger stadium playing soccer. This has been my life-long favorite past time ever since I was a little kid and it has been a huge part of my life. I’m currently the captain for the <a href="http://www.drewrangers.com/roster.aspx?path=msoc" target="_blank">Drew University Men’s Soccer Team</a> and enjoy spending most of my free time being part of this team and playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beautiful_Game" target="_blank">the beautiful game</a>.</p>

            <p>But that’s enough about what I do, now let me tell you who I am and where I come from. I am originally from a town called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filandia,_Quind%C3%ADo" target="_blank">Filandia</a> located in the beautiful country of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" target="_blank">Colombia</a> (You should visit if you haven’t, definitely worth it). I moved to the United States in 2005 at the age of eleven with hopes for a better life. Back then I did not know any English, so it was definitely a rough time in my life that challenged me in every way possible, from learning a new language to adapting to a entirely different culture. However, I have to say I’m glad I had to go through this experience, because it was definitely a turning point in my life that shaped me into the hard working and responsible person I am today.</p>

          <h3><strong>Check out my awesome work...</strong> </h3>

          <p> These are some of the projects I've had the chance to work on during my short career as a web developer.</p>

              <div class="portfolio-item"><a href="#" data-toggle="adaptive-modal" data-title="<img src='img/jackedup.jpg'></div><p>One of my favorite things to do in the entire world is to workout. However, at times working out can be very time consuming. This is why when I am really busy I like to do short, yet intense workouts, that allow me to keep up my daily routine. Whenever I'm in this situation I like to do the 'deck of cards workout'. As the name implies, this workout requires a deck of cards (52 cards) in order to perform it. The way it works is that the user assigns an exercise (push up, sit up, pull up, etc.) to each one of the 4 suits in the deck. Then, to start the workout, the user randomly pulls a card out of the deck and depending on the suit and the number of the card, the user performs the predetermined exercise, for that number of repetitions. After doing this workout for a while I realized how inconvenient it was to use a physical deck of cards, as they would get sweaty and at times I would lose some of them. Since I had some experience with developing ruby on rails applications, I decided this was the perfect idea for a project that would allow me to practice and at the same time build a useful tool. As a result, JackedUp was born. JackedUp is an application that allows the user to perform a quick, yet challenging workout without the need of a physical deck of cards.

              <div class="portfolio-item"><a href="#" data-toggle="adaptive-modal" data-title="<img src='img/positivepublications.jpg'></div><p>This past summer I was given the opportunity to work on a website for Positive Publications, LLC. This was a great opportunity for me as it allowed me to have the freedom of designing, developing and launching a website all on my own. I developed this static site from scratch using Jekyll (for faster development), and used front-end developing languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as some JQuery in order to enhance its user experience. </p><h2><a href='http://www.positivepublications.us/' target='_blank' id='visit-me'>visit page</a><h2> " data-am-custom-class="modal1" class="custom"><img src="img/positivepublications.jpg"></a>

This project was one of the most challenging projects I've worked on, since the website was a bit outdated and it was built on .NET, which was a framework that I had no previous experience with. I had to research and learn a lot on my free time in order to be able to figure out the existing code and on top of that add my own code to make the website better. Fortunately, I was able to successfully improve the structure of the home page. Once this stage of the project was done, I was able to work closely with NASDAQ on an integration of a newsfeed section, which shows live news from NASDAQ GLOBE NEWS WIRE using an rss widget. This was a very cool experience, as it was the start of the magazine's relationship with NASDAQ as one of their network distributors. (This <a href='img/industry_today_times_square.jpg' target='_blank'>picture</a> was taken at Times Square and it shows the tower display that NASDAQ put up as an announcement of our relationship!)</p><h2><a href='http://industrytoday.com/' target='_blank' id='visit-me'>visit page</a><h2> " data-am-custom-class="modal1" class="custom"><img src="img/industrytoday.jpg"></a>

              <p> I'm currently looking for an internship opportunity to work as a Front-End developer. I believe that practice makes perfect, and I am very interested in working on real life projects in order to be able to challenge my developing abilities and further increase my knowledge in the field.
