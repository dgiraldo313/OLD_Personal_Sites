            <h3><strong>Hello there...</strong> </h3>
            <p>My name is Daniel Giraldo and I’m a Junior at <a href="http://www.drew.edu" target="_blank">Drew University</a>. I'm currently pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science, and  minoring in Spanish Studies and Economics. My favorite class so far during my three years at Drew has definitely been the introduction to Computer Science. This class allowed me to find in me a passion for programming and learn more about my problem solving abilities.</p>

            <p>When I’m not hitting the books you will most likely find me out on the Drew Ranger stadium playing soccer. This has been my life-long favorite past time ever since I was a little kid and it has been a huge part of my life. I’m currently the captain for the <a href="http://www.drewrangers.com/roster.aspx?path=msoc" target="_blank">Drew University Men’s Soccer Team</a> and enjoy spending most of my free time being part of this team and playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beautiful_Game" target="_blank">the beautiful game</a>.</p>

            <p>But that’s enough about what I do now, let me tell you where I come from and who I am. I am originally from a town called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filandia,_Quind%C3%ADo" target="_blank">Filandia</a> located in the beautiful country of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" target="_blank">Colombia</a> (You should visit if you haven’t, definitely worth it). I moved to the United States in 2005 at the age of eleven with hopes of a better life. Back then I did not know any English, so it was definitely a tough time in my life and it took some time to overcome as well as some courage. However, I got to say I’m glad I had to go through this experience, because it was definitely a turning point in my life that shaped me into the hard working and responsible person I am today.</p>

              <p> I'm currently looking for an internship opportunity to work as a Front-End developer. I believe that practice makes perfect, and I am very interested in working on real life projects in order to be able to challenge my developing abilities and further increase my knowledge in the field.  If you know about any opportunities or think I will be a good fit for your company, please don’t hesitate to shoot me an email or give me a call.</p>
